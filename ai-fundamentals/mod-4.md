# Supervised Learning: Regression

**Duration:** 15 min

## Overview

Supervised Learning: Regression is a critical component of ai-fundamentals that professionals encounter regularly in production systems.

## Core Concepts

Understanding Supervised Learning: Regression requires grasping several interconnected ideas:

**Principle 1** - The foundational concept that everything else builds upon. This appears consistently across different implementations and contexts.

**Principle 2** - How theory translates into practical systems. This principle shapes architectural decisions at every scale.

**Principle 3** - The integration point where Supervised Learning: Regression connects with other system components. Mastering this prevents common failures.

## Key Techniques

**Technique 1** - The standard approach used by most practitioners. Reliable, well-documented, appropriate for typical scenarios.

**Technique 2** - The high-performance variant used when standard approaches don't meet requirements. Requires deeper understanding but provides better results in constrained situations.

**Technique 3** - The robust variant that handles edge cases and degraded conditions. Essential for production systems that can't fail silently.

## Implementation Guide

Implementing Supervised Learning: Regression effectively requires:

1. **Clear Requirements** - Understand exactly what you're trying to accomplish before starting
2. **Design Pattern Selection** - Choose an approach appropriate for your constraints
3. **Iterative Development** - Build incrementally, testing at each stage
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Validate with realistic data before deployment
5. **Production Monitoring** - Observe behavior in the real environment

## Real-World Patterns

Professionals apply Supervised Learning: Regression in diverse ways depending on context:

- **High-Throughput Systems** - Optimization strategies differ from real-time systems
- **Resource-Constrained Environments** - Techniques vary when hardware is limited
- **Distributed Systems** - Supervised Learning: Regression behaves differently at scale
- **Mission-Critical Applications** - Different tradeoffs when failures are expensive

## Common Mistakes

Learning from others' experiences:
- Insufficient planning before implementation
- Over-optimization before identifying real bottlenecks
- Inadequate error handling in production
- Lack of monitoring for degradation

## Best Practices

- Measure before you optimize
- Start simple and add complexity only when needed
- Document your design decisions for future maintainers
- Build observability into systems from the start
- Plan for maintenance and operational updates


## Code Examples

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample dataset
data = {
   'square_footage': [1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000],
    'bedrooms': [3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5],
    'price': [300000, 320000, 340000, 360000, 380000, 400000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features and target variable
X = df[['square_footage', 'bedrooms']]
y = df['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'time': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    'price': [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features and target variable
X = df[['time']]
y = df['price']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
degree = 2
model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree), LinearRegression())
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```
